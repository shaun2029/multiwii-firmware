Pinouts & Motor Layout: See file HobbyKing_MultiWii_328P_Pinouts.png

NOTE:   Changed pinouts for Pitch, Roll, Throttle, Yaw & Aux1 for easy connectâ€¦ to a Devo RX701 receiver.

The battery low connector now works. Construct a voltage divider consisting of a 33k and 10k resistors. 
The 33k resistor conects to the battery positive and the 10k resistor to ground.
The connection between the resistors is connected to the Bat pin on the board (A7).
